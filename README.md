# CodeMouse92's Quick Installer

This is a script I use to quickly install recommended packages on systems I am repairing.
It automatically adds the official or best PPAs for packages, when possible. See the
`-h` command for help.

Before you use this yourself, I recommend you carefully review what packages will be installed.
The `-L` option will list the packages and their sources.

**Only intended to be used with Ubuntu 18.04 and later.**

## Installation

```bash
wget https://github.com/CodeMouse92/quick_installer/blob/master/quick_installer.sh
