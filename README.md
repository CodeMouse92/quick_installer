# quick_installer

This is a script I use to quickly install recommended packages on systems I am repairing.
It automatically adds the official or best PPAs for packages, when possible.

Before you use this yourself, I recommend you carefully review what packages will be installed.
The `-L` option will list the packages and their sources.

**Only intended to be used with Ubuntu 18.04 and later.**
